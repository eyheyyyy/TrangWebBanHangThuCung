# Frontend scaffold

This is a minimal static frontend scaffold for the TrangWebBanHangThuCung project. It contains a small static page to preview product UI.

Files:
- `index.html` — entry
- `src/style.css` — styles
- `src/app.js` — small demo script

To serve locally you can use any static server, for example with Node installed:

```bash
# from this folder
npx serve .
```
